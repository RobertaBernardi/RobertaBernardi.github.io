**Description**   

Telehealth promises to increase efficiency in health care, particularly, by cutting costs in the care of patients affected by chronic diseases (e.g. by reducing number of hospital visits/admissions). Yet, health service management research has proven that its benefits can hardly be achieved without the necessary level of participation and commitment from various stakeholders. Telehealth scalability requires a new mind-set in the re-organization and delivery of health care services and a re-alignment of interests among NHS and other implementing partners, who have different expectations regarding the value of telehealth. The objective of this research is to understand: the learning process and cultural shifts that relevant CCG members and NHS staff have to cope with in the implementation of telehealth services; the quality of relationships CCGs manage to establish among implementing partners; the potential impact of these relationships on telehealth sustainability and scalability. The research can provide the CCGs and their telehealth partners with a better understanding of how local human resources and management structures should be re-organized and the main cultural change needed to increase telehealth cost-effectiveness. Findings from this research have shown the role of the hybrid identities of clinical managers in facilitating the adoption of telehealth (see [Bernardi and Exworthy, 2020](/files/PDF/2020-Bernardi-Exworthy-ISJ.pdf)).
