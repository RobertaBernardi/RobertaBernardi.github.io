Welcome! I am a Senior Lecturer in Management and Programme Director of the MSc Business Analytics at the University of Bristol. I earned my PhD from the University of Warwick in 2012 and have more than 10 years of experience researching digital innovation in healthcare. I have done research on the diffusion and adoption of health information systems and telehealth from various theoretical perspectives, including institutional theory, affordances, identity theory, and the sociology of professions. My recent work focuses on the impact of online health communities and social media on medical expertise, medical knowledge, and healthcare innovation. I am an experienced qualitative researcher and am currently working on combining text analytics with human interpretations of texts to advance the analytical as well as interpretative power of narrative methodologies in the analysis of social media conversations. My research features in world leading journals such as Management Information Systems Quarterly, the Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Information Systems Journal, and Social Science & Medicine. I am Associate Editor of the Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Information Systems Journal, and serve as Senior Editor of Information Technology and People. As a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (UK), I have made notable contributions to teaching. A firm believer in the power of information technologies and data in addressing industry and societal challenges, I have designed and led courses on digital innovation, data analytics, and Artificial Intelligence for business where students have been involved in group and individual projects to solve real business scenario challenges and problems.
